### A01:2025 – Broken Access Control

**Description:** Access control enforces policies that prevent users from acting outside their intended permissions. Failures lead to unauthorized data disclosure, modification, or destruction.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Bypassing access control by modifying URLs, application state, or HTML pages
- Allowing primary key changes to access others' records (IDOR)
- Privilege escalation (acting as admin while logged in as user)
- Missing access control for POST, PUT, DELETE APIs
- CORS misconfiguration allowing unauthorized API access

**Prevention:**
```python
# BAD: No authorization check
@app.route('/api/user/<user_id>')
def get_user(user_id):
    return db.get_user(user_id)

# GOOD: Authorization enforced
@app.route('/api/user/<user_id>')
@login_required
def get_user(user_id):
    if current_user.id != user_id and not current_user.is_admin:
        abort(403)
    return db.get_user(user_id)
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Deny access by default (allowlist approach)
2. Implement access control once, reuse throughout application
3. Enforce record ownership instead of accepting user-supplied IDs
4. Disable directory listing and remove sensitive files from web roots
5. Log access control failures and alert on repeated attempts
6. Rate limit API access to minimize automated attack damage

---

### A02:2025 – Security Misconfiguration

**Description:** Applications are vulnerable when security hardening is missing, cloud permissions are improperly configured, unnecessary features are enabled, or default accounts remain active.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing security hardening across the application stack
- Unnecessary features enabled (ports, services, pages, accounts)
- Default credentials unchanged
- Error handling revealing stack traces
- Outdated or vulnerable software components
- Insecure cloud storage permissions (S3 buckets public)

**Prevention:**
```yaml
# BAD: Debug mode in production
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY="development-key"

# GOOD: Production hardened
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY="${RANDOM_SECRET_FROM_VAULT}"
ALLOWED_HOSTS=["app.example.com"]
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Automated, repeatable hardening process across environments
2. Minimal platform without unnecessary features or frameworks
3. Regularly review and update configurations (cloud permissions, patches)
4. Segmented application architecture with secure separation
5. Send security directives (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
6. Automated verification of configurations in all environments

---

### A03:2025 – Software Supply Chain Failures

**Description:** NEW category highlighting risks from third-party dependencies, compromised build pipelines, and insecure package management. Expanded from 2021's component vulnerabilities focus.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Using components with known vulnerabilities
- Dependency confusion attacks
- Typosquatting in package registries
- Compromised CI/CD pipelines
- Unsigned or unverified packages
- Lack of software bill of materials (SBOM)

**Prevention:**
```bash
# BAD: Installing without verification
npm install some-package

# GOOD: Lock versions, verify integrity, audit
npm install some-package@1.2.3 --save-exact
npm audit
npm audit signatures
```

```json
// package-lock.json with integrity hashes
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": {
      "version": "4.17.21",
      "integrity": "sha512-v2kDEe57lecT..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Maintain inventory of all components (SBOM)
2. Remove unused dependencies and features
3. Continuously monitor for vulnerabilities (Dependabot, Snyk)
4. Obtain components from official sources over secure links
5. Sign packages and verify signatures
6. Ensure CI/CD pipelines have proper access controls and audit logs
7. Use lock files and verify integrity hashes

---

### A04:2025 – Cryptographic Failures

**Description:** Failures related to cryptography that lead to exposure of sensitive data. Includes weak algorithms, improper key management, and missing encryption.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Transmitting data in clear text (HTTP, SMTP, FTP)
- Using deprecated algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES)
- Weak or default cryptographic keys
- Missing certificate validation
- Using encryption without authenticated modes
- Insufficient entropy for random number generation

**Prevention:**
```python
# BAD: Weak hashing
import hashlib
password_hash = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()

# GOOD: Modern password hashing
from argon2 import PasswordHasher
ph = PasswordHasher()
password_hash = ph.hash(password)

# BAD: ECB mode
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)

# GOOD: Authenticated encryption
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
cipher = Fernet(key)
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Classify data by sensitivity; apply controls accordingly
2. Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily
3. Encrypt all data in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest
4. Use strong, current algorithms (AES-256-GCM, Argon2, bcrypt)
5. Encrypt with authenticated modes (GCM, CCM)
6. Generate keys randomly; store securely (HSM, vault)
7. Disable caching for sensitive responses

---

### A05:2025 – Injection

**Description:** Injection occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. Includes SQL, NoSQL, OS, LDAP, and expression language injection.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- User input not validated, filtered, or sanitized
- Dynamic queries without parameterization
- Hostile data used in ORM search parameters
- Direct concatenation of user input in commands

**Prevention:**
```python
# BAD: SQL Injection vulnerable
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
cursor.execute(query)

# GOOD: Parameterized query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))

# BAD: Command injection
os.system(f"convert {filename} output.png")

# GOOD: Use safe APIs, avoid shell
subprocess.run(["convert", filename, "output.png"], shell=False)
```

```javascript
// BAD: NoSQL injection
db.users.find({ username: req.body.username })

// GOOD: Validate type
if (typeof req.body.username !== 'string') throw new Error();
db.users.find({ username: req.body.username })
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Use safe APIs with parameterized interfaces
2. Validate all input using allowlists
3. Escape special characters for specific interpreters
4. Use LIMIT and pagination to prevent mass disclosure
5. Implement positive server-side input validation

---

### A06:2025 – Insecure Design

**Description:** Flaws in design and architecture that cannot be fixed by perfect implementation. Represents missing or ineffective security controls at the design phase.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing rate limiting on sensitive operations
- No account lockout for failed authentication
- Lack of tenant isolation in multi-tenant systems
- Missing fraud detection controls
- Insufficient trust boundaries

**Prevention:**
```python
# BAD: No rate limiting on password reset
@app.route('/password-reset', methods=['POST'])
def password_reset():
    send_reset_email(request.form['email'])
    return "Email sent"

# GOOD: Rate limiting and verification
from flask_limiter import Limiter
limiter = Limiter(app)

@app.route('/password-reset', methods=['POST'])
@limiter.limit("3 per hour")
def password_reset():
    email = request.form['email']
    if not is_valid_email_format(email):
        abort(400)
    # Use consistent timing to prevent enumeration
    send_reset_email_async(email)
    return "If account exists, email was sent"
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Establish secure development lifecycle with security experts
2. Create and use secure design patterns library
3. Threat modeling for authentication, access control, business logic
4. Integrate security language in user stories
5. Implement tenant isolation and resource limits
6. Limit resource consumption per user/service

---

### A07:2025 – Identification and Authentication Failures

**Description:** Confirmation of user identity, authentication, and session management is critical. Weaknesses allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Permitting weak or well-known passwords
- Using weak credential recovery (knowledge-based answers)
- Plain text or weakly hashed passwords
- Missing or ineffective MFA
- Exposing session IDs in URLs
- Not properly invalidating sessions on logout

**Prevention:**
```python
# Password strength requirements
import re
def validate_password(password):
    if len(password) < 12:
        return False
    if password in COMMON_PASSWORDS:  # Check against breach lists
        return False
    return True

# Session management
@app.route('/logout')
@login_required
def logout():
    session.clear()  # Clear server-side session
    response = redirect('/')
    response.delete_cookie('session')
    return response
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Implement MFA to prevent automated attacks
2. Avoid shipping with default credentials
3. Check passwords against known breached password lists
4. Align password policies with NIST 800-63b
5. Harden against enumeration attacks (consistent responses)
6. Limit failed login attempts with exponential backoff
7. Use server-side, secure session manager; regenerate IDs after login

---

### A08:2025 – Software and Data Integrity Failures

**Description:** Code and infrastructure that doesn't protect against integrity violations. Includes insecure deserialization, trusting unsigned updates, and CI/CD without verification.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Applications relying on untrusted CDNs or repositories
- Auto-update without integrity verification
- Insecure deserialization of untrusted data
- CI/CD pipelines without proper access controls
- Unsigned or unverified code deployments

**Prevention:**
```html
<!-- BAD: CDN without integrity -->
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/lib.js"></script>

<!-- GOOD: Subresource Integrity -->
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/lib.js"
        integrity="sha384-abc123..."
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

```python
# BAD: Unsafe deserialization
import pickle
data = pickle.loads(user_input)

# GOOD: Safe serialization with validation
import json
data = json.loads(user_input)
validate_schema(data)
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Use digital signatures to verify software/data from expected source
2. Ensure dependencies are from trusted repositories
3. Use software supply chain security tools (OWASP Dependency-Check)
4. Review code and configuration changes
5. Ensure CI/CD has proper segregation, configuration, and access control
6. Don't send unsigned/unencrypted serialized data to untrusted clients

---

### A09:2025 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

**Description:** Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected. Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and response allows attackers to persist.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Auditable events not logged (logins, failed logins, transactions)
- Warnings and errors generate unclear log messages
- Logs only stored locally
- Alerting thresholds not set or ineffective
- Penetration tests don't trigger alerts
- Application can't detect active attacks in real-time

**Prevention:**
```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

# Configure structured logging
logging.basicConfig(
    format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(message)s',
    level=logging.INFO
)
logger = logging.getLogger('security')

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    user = authenticate(request.form['username'], request.form['password'])
    if user:
        logger.info(f"LOGIN_SUCCESS user={user.id} ip={request.remote_addr}")
        return redirect('/dashboard')
    else:
        logger.warning(f"LOGIN_FAILURE username={request.form['username']} ip={request.remote_addr}")
        return "Invalid credentials", 401
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Log all login, access control, and server-side validation failures
2. Generate logs in format consumable by log management solutions
3. Encode log data correctly to prevent injection attacks
4. Ensure high-value transactions have audit trail with integrity controls
5. Establish effective monitoring and alerting
6. Create incident response and recovery plan (NIST 800-61r2)

---

### A10:2025 – Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions

**Description:** NEW category addressing failures in handling errors, edge cases, and unexpected states. Poor exception handling can leak information or cause security failures.

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- Exposing stack traces to users
- Inconsistent error handling between components
- Fail-open behavior (allowing access on error)
- Resource exhaustion without graceful degradation
- Race conditions in error paths
- Incomplete transaction rollbacks

**Prevention:**
```python
# BAD: Leaking information
@app.errorhandler(Exception)
def handle_error(e):
    return str(e), 500  # Exposes internal details

# GOOD: Secure error handling
@app.errorhandler(Exception)
def handle_error(e):
    error_id = uuid.uuid4()
    logger.exception(f"Error {error_id}: {e}")
    return {"error": "An error occurred", "id": str(error_id)}, 500
```

```python
# BAD: Fail-open
def check_permission(user, resource):
    try:
        return authorization_service.check(user, resource)
    except Exception:
        return True  # Fail-open!

# GOOD: Fail-closed
def check_permission(user, resource):
    try:
        return authorization_service.check(user, resource)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Auth check failed: {e}")
        return False  # Fail-closed
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Design for failure: expect and handle all error conditions
2. Implement fail-closed (deny by default) on errors
3. Use structured exception handling with appropriate granularity
4. Never expose internal errors to end users
5. Log all exceptions with context for debugging
6. Test error handling paths as thoroughly as happy paths
7. Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies

## Key Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
Layer multiple security controls so that if one fails, others provide protection.

### Least Privilege
Grant minimum permissions necessary for functionality. Regularly review and revoke unnecessary access.

### Fail Secure
When errors occur, default to a secure state. Deny access rather than allow it when uncertain.

### Zero Trust
Never trust, always verify. Authenticate and authorize every request regardless of source.

### Secure by Default
Ship products with secure defaults. Require explicit action to reduce security.

### Input Validation
Validate all input on the server side. Use allowlists over denylists.

### Output Encoding
Encode output based on context (HTML, JavaScript, SQL, etc.) to prevent injection.

### Keep Security Simple
Complex security is often bypassed. Prefer simple, understandable controls.
