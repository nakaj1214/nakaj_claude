# Slack approval skip patterns
# Format: <action>:<prefix_pattern>
# action: skip (no approval needed) or require (always require approval)
# Evaluated top-to-bottom; first match wins.
# Note: Shell metachar/redirect detection (>, >>, <, $(...), etc.) runs BEFORE
#       these patterns and always forces require regardless of what's listed below.

# --- Always require approval (dangerous operations - listed before skip) ---
require:rm -rf
require:git push
require:git reset --hard
require:docker rm
require:docker rmi

# --- Read-only (no approval needed) ---
skip:ls
skip:cat
skip:grep
skip:head
skip:tail
skip:git status
skip:git log
skip:git diff
skip:git show
skip:git branch
skip:php artisan route:list
skip:php artisan config:show
skip:echo
skip:pwd
skip:which

# --- Everything else requires approval (default: require) ---
